# Light Reader

**Light Reader** is a **Chrome browser extension** designed to analyze web pages. Light Reader will generate a light mode that aims to improve **web accessibility** for the majority of users by **reducing eyestrain** and **improving text readibility** by forcing a light theme (black text on white background) and sans serif font (Tahoma) by default.

## Purpose

Dark text on a light background, also known as light, day, or positive polarity modes, has been shown to increase legibility, reduce eye strain, and improve memorability.

This emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity often helps individuals with disabilities and those without. This extension was created to address the gap, as several dark mode extensions already exist, such as [Dark Reader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader).
