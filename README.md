# Light Reader

**Light Reader** is a **Chrome browser extension** designed to analyze web pages. Light Reader will generate a light mode that aims to improve **web accessibility** for the majority of users by **reducing eyestrain** and **improving text readibility** by forcing a light theme (black text on white background) and sans serif font (Tahoma) by default.

## Purpose

### Light Mode

Dark text on a light background, also known as light, day, or positive polarity modes, has been shown to increase legibility, reduce eye strain, and improve memorability.

This emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity often helps individuals with disabilities and those without. This extension was created to address the gap, as several dark mode extensions already exist, such as [Dark Reader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader).

### Tahoma Font

Sans serif fonts, which lack decorative elements, are often preferred in digital content due to their higher legibility, especially for people with visual impairments. Tahoma, in particular, is superior to fonts like Arial because each letter in Tahoma is more distinct, reducing the chances of characters being confused with one another.

Additionally, Tahoma has slightly more space between letters, improving readability and making it easier to read on-screen text, especially on websites that use overly ornate or difficult-to-read serif fonts.
