# Why Light Mode?

Dark text on a light background, also known as light, day, or positive polarity modes, has been shown to increase legibility, reduce eye strain, and improve memorability.

This emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity often helps individuals with disabilities and those without. This extension was created to address the gap, as several dark mode extensions already exist, such as [Dark Reader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader).

## Summary

Light mode provides significant benefits for individuals with the following conditions and disabilities:

- **Astigmatism (50% of humans):** Astigmatism makes reading white text on a dark background more difficult due to the distortion of the lens.
- **Myopia (30% of humans):**  Myopia causes halo effects or blurriness when viewing light text on dark backgrounds.
- **Presbyopia (40% of humans):** Those age 40+ experience presbyopia, causing difficulty focusing on close-up text, which makes light mode’s higher contrast easier on their eyes.
- **Older Adults (30% of humans):** Those age 50+ experience declining visual acuity, making light mode's high contrast and legibility more effective for reading.
- **General Population:** Light mode generally improves readability and comfort for everyone by providing higher contrast and clearer text, making it easier to read and reducing eye strain for people of all ages and visual abilities.

### Legibility

[University of British Columbia via Gizmodo - Why Computer Screens Aren’t Green-On-Black Any More](https://gizmodo.com.au/2014/10/the-surprising-reason-computer-screens-arent-green-on-black-anymore/):
> People with astigmatism (approximately 50% of the population) find it harder to read white text on black than black text on white. Part of this has to do with light levels: with a bright display (white background) the iris closes a bit more, decreasing the effect of the “deformed” lens; with a dark display (black background) the iris opens to receive more light and the deformation of the lens creates a much fuzzier focus at the eye.

[Nationwide Vision - Is Dark Mode Better for Your Eyes?](https://www.nationwidevision.com/eye-care-resources/is-dark-mode-better-for-your-eyes):
> White text on a dark screen may cause a halo effect. A halo effect is when a blur of light surrounds the brightness amid the darkness. This may affect people with myopia (nearsightedness), astigmatism, or presbyopia.

> Studies have shown that dark characters on light background (positive polarity) lead to better legibility than do light characters on dark background (negative polarity)... Negative polarity displays should be avoided.

> In display design under negative polarity, experimental results show that higher brightness contrast leads to higher legibility, while background colour has no such significant effect.

### Readability

> Brighter positive polarity displays should help to compensate for this decline and, accordingly, lead to better performance than darker negative polarity displays... Visual acuity testing and a proofreading task revealed a positive polarity advantage for younger and older adults. Dark characters on light background lead to better legibility and are strongly recommended independent of observer's age.

> In every color combination surveyed, the darker text on a lighter background was rated more readable than its inverse.

### Comprehension

[TidBITS - The Dark Side of Dark Mode](https://tidbits.com/2019/05/31/the-dark-side-of-dark-mode/):
> The human eyes and brain prefer dark-on-light, and reversing that forces them to work harder to read text, parse controls, and comprehend what you’re seeing.

[Rosely - Light vs Dark Modes](https://rosely.hellotham.com/docs/concepts/light-vs-dark/):
> A dark theme puts us in “night vision mode” where we are constantly on the lookout for danger coming from any angle.

[Semantic Scholar - "Positive Display Polarity Is Particularly Advantageous for Small Character Sizes"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Positive-Display-Polarity-Is-Particularly-Advantageous-for-Small-Character-Sizes):
> A positive polarity advantage was observed in proofreading performance... Higher luminance of positive polarity displays leads to an improved perception of detail.

### Negatives

Some users with specific eye conditions may prefer light text on dark backgrounds (negative polarity), which can also conserve battery on OLED screens and reduce disruption of circadian rhythms. However, Light Reader focuses on improving accessibility in specific ways for those who benefit from it.
