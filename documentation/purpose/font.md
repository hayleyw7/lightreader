# Why Tahoma?

Sans serif fonts, which lack decorative elements, are often preferred in digital content due to their higher legibility, especially for people with visual impairments. Tahoma, in particular, is superior to fonts like Arial because each letter in Tahoma is more distinct, reducing the chances of characters being confused with one another.

Additionally, Tahoma has slightly more space between letters, improving readability and making it easier to read on-screen text, especially on websites that use overly ornate or difficult-to-read serif fonts.

### Negatives

Tahoma may not be ideal for people with dyslexia and is generally not preferred for coding due to its character spacing and design. However, Light Reader focuses on improving accessibility in specific ways for those who benefit from it.
